Fridge Raid is designed for people who:

- **Don't know what to cook**  
  Instead of trying to come up with ideas from scratch, the app gives you instant suggestions based on what's already available.

- **Want to use up ingredients**  
  By inputting what you have, the app helps you find recipes that make the most of your existing pantry, reducing the chance of food going bad.

- **Lack inspiration**  
  It introduces you to new recipes and combinations you might not have thought of on your own.
